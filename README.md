# NLP-tracker
(not completed or working on this actively)
Track sentiment over time

## Initial setup:
1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 for Numpy support
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run nltk_setup.py to download needed NLT library

## Appending revisions:
1. Manually install pip dependencies
2. ```pip freeze > requirements.txt``` *maybe not because this will also add dependencies of required packages*
